=head1 NAME

When - a minimalistic personal calendar program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

when

when [options] [commands]

The basic idea is just to type `when' at the command line. The first time
you run the program, it will prompt you for some setup information. To
edit you calendar file in your favorite editor, do `when e'. The basic
format of the calendar file is like this:

        2003 feb 3 , Fly to Stockholm to accept Nobel Prize.

Once you have a calendar file, running the program as plain old `when'
from the command line will print out the things on your calendar for the
next two weeks.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 8

=item B<i>

Print upcoming items on your calendar. (This is the default command.)

=item B<c>

Print calendars (grids like on a wall calendar, not showing items)
for last month, this month, and next month.

=item B<e>

Invoke your favorite editor to edit your calendar file.

=item B<w>,B<m>,B<y>

Print items for the coming week, month, or year, rather
than for the default period of two weeks.

=item B<j>

Print the modified Julian day (useful for finding the time interval
between two dates).

=item B<d>

Print nothing but the current date.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

All of the following options, except --help, can be set in the preferences
file. True/false options can be set on the command line as --option or
--nooption, and in the preferences file by setting the option to 0 or 1.

=over 8

=item --help

Prints a brief help message.

=item --version

Prints a brief message, including a statement of what version of the
software it is.

=item --language=LANG

Set the language to LANG. See the section below on internationalization.
This option is not normally needed, because the language is automatically
detected.

=item --future=DAYS

How many days into the future the report extends. Default: 14

=item --past=DAYS

How many days into the past the report extends. Like the --future option,
--past is interpreted as an offset relative to the present date, so normally
you would want this to be a negative value. Default: -1

=item --calendar=FILE

Your calendar file. The default is to use the file pointed to
by your preferences file, which is set up the first time you
run When.

=item --editor=COMMAND

Command used to invoke your editor. Default: "emacs -nw"
Example:  when --editor="vim"

=item --wrap=COLUMNS

Number of columns of text for the output (or 0 if you don't want
wrapping at all). Default: 80

=item --[no]wrap_auto

Attempt to detect the width of the terminal, and set the width of the output
accordingly. This applies only if the output is a tty, and is subject to any
maximum set by --wrap_max. Overrides any value set by --wrap. Default: no

=item --wrap_max=COLUMNS

Maximum number of columns of text for the output (or -1 if you don't want
any maximum). Useful in combination with --wrap_auto to preserve legibility
on very large terminal windows. Default: -1

=item --rows=COLUMNS

Number of rows of text that will fit in the terminal window.
When listing your calendar, output will be truncated to this
length, unless that would result in listing less than three days
into the future. This behavior is overridden (the maximum number
of rows is set to infinity) if the --future option is given
explicitly, or if the m or y command is
used.
Default: 40

=item --[no]rows_auto

Attempt to detect the height of the terminal, rather than using the value
set in the --rows option. This applies only if the output is a tty.
Overrides any value set by --rows. Default: yes

=item --[no]header

Print headers at the top of the output of the i, c, w, m and y commands.
Default: yes

=item --[no]paging

When the output is longer than the value set by rows or rows_auto, use
a pager to display the output. (The PAGER and LESS environment variables
are respected. If PAGER isn't set, the default is "less.") Default: yes

=item --paging_less_options

Extra options if the pager is "less." Default: "-rXFE"

=item --[no]filter_accents_on_output

Whether to change accented characters to unaccented ones.
Default: yes, unless the $TERM environment variable equals "mlterm"
or "xterm".

=item --[no]styled_output

If the output is a terminal, should we use ANSI terminal codes for
styling? Default: yes

=item --[no]styled_output_if_not_tty

Style the output even if it's not a terminal. Default: no

=item --calendar_today_style=STYLE

=item --items_today_style=STYLE

The first of these says how to style today's date when doing the calendar (c) command.
The second says how to style the word ``today'' when doing the items (i) command.
Defaults: bold

The styling of output can be specified using the following keywords:
bold, underlined, flashing.
To change the color of the text, use these:
fgblack, fgred, fggreen, fgyellow, fgblue, fgpurple, fgcyan,
fgwhite.
To change the background color, use similar keywords, but with bg instead
of fg. Example:
when --calendar_today_style="bold,fgred,bgcyan" c

=item --prefilter

Pipe the calendar file through a program before reading it. Default: ""

=item --now="Y M D"

Pretend today is some other date.

=item --[no]neighboring_months

The default behavior of "when c" is to print out calendars for
last month, this month, and next month. By choosing --noneighboring_months,
you can avoid printing out months not included in the range set by
--past and --future.

=item --[no]monday_first

Start the week from Monday, rather than Sunday. Default: no

=item --[no]orthodox_easter

Calculate Easter according to the Orthodox Eastern Church's calendar. Default: no

=item --[no]ampm

Display the time of day using 12-hour time, rather than 24-hour time. Also
affects the parsing of input times.
Default: yes

=item --auto_pm=x

When times are input with hours that are less than x, and AM or PM is not explicitly
specified, automatically assume that they are PM rather than AM. Default: 0

=item --[no]literal_only

Only display items that are given as literal dates, e.g., "2008 jul 4". Don't
display items that are defined by expressions, e.g., periodic items like
"w=thu". Default: no

=item --test_expression

=item --bare_version

=item --make_filter_regex

=item --test_accent_filtering

These options are used internally for building and testing.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<When> is an extremely simple personal calendar program, aimed at the Unix
geek who wants something minimalistic. It can keep track of things you need to
do on particular dates. There are a lot of calendar and ``personal information
manager'' programs out there, so what reasons are there to use B<When>?

=over 4

=item It's a very short and simple program, so you can easily tinker with it
  yourself.

=item It doesn't depend on any libraries, so it's easy to install. You should
  be able to install it on any system where Perl is available, even if you
  don't have privileges for installing libraries.

=item Its file format is a simple text file, which you can edit in your favorite
  editor.

=back

Although B<When> should run on virtually any operating system where Perl is
available, in this document I'll assume you're running some
flavor of Unix.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND GETTING STARTED

While logged in as root, execute the following command:

       make install

Run B<When> for the first time using this command:

       when

You'll be prompted for some information needed to set up your calendar file.

=head1 USE

If you run B<When> again after the initial setup run, it should print out a
single line of text, telling you the current date. It won't print out
anything else, because your calendar file is empty, so you don't have
any appointments coming up.

Now you can start putting items in your calendar file. Each item is a line
of text that looks like this:

        2003 feb 3 , Fly to Stockholm to accept Nobel Prize.

A convenient way to edit your calendar file is with this command:

        when e

This pops you into your favorite editor (the one you chose when you ran
B<When> for the first time).

The date has to be in year-month-day format, but you can either spell the
month or give it as a number. (Month names are case-insensitive, and it
doesn't matter if you represent February as F, Fe, Feb, Februa, or whatever.
It just has to be a unique match. You can give a trailing ., which will be
ignored. In Czech, "cer" can be used as an abbreviation for Cerven, and "cec" for
Cervenec.) Extra whitespace is
ignored until you get into the actual text after the comma. Blank lines
and lines beginning with a # sign are ignored.

If you now run B<When>, it will print out a list of all the items in your
calendar file that fall within a certain time interval. (The interval starts from
yesterday. B<When> tries to pick the end of the time interval so that its output
fits on your terminal window, but it will always be at least three days, and
no more than two weeks in the future.)
To see all your items for the next month, do ``when m'',
and similarly for a year, y, or a single week, w.

If you do ``when c'', B<When> prints out calendars for last month, this month,
and next month.

You can combine these commands. For instance, ``when cw'' will print
out calendars, and then show you your items for the next week.

For events that occur once a year, such as birthdays and annivesaries,
you can either use a * in place of the year,

        * dec 25 , Christmas

or use a year with an asterisk:

        1920* aug 29 , Charlie Parker turns \a, born in \y

In the second example, \a tells you how old Charlie Parker would be this
year, and \y reproduces the year he was born, i.e., the output would be:

        today     2003 Aug 29 Charlie Parker turns 83, born in 1920

For things you have to do every week, you can use an expression of the
form w=xxx, where xxx is the first few letters of the name of the day
of the week in your language. (You have to supply enough letters to
eliminate ambiguity, e.g., in English, w=th or w=tu, not just w=t.)
Example:

        w=sun , go to church, 10:00

You can actually do fancier tests than this as well; for more information,
see the section 'fancy tests' below.
Here's how to set up some common holidays:

        m=jan & w=mon & a=3 , Martin Luther King Day
        * feb 14 , Valentine's Day
	m=feb & w=mon & a=3 , Washington's Birthday observed
        m=may & w=sun & a=2 , Mother's Day
        m=may & w=mon & b=1 , Memorial Day
        m=jun & w=sun & a=3 , Father's Day
	* jul 4 , Independence Day
        m=sep & w=mon & a=1 , Labor Day
	m=oct & w=mon & a=2 , Columbus Day
        m=oct & w=mon & a=2 , Thanksgiving (Canada)
	* nov 11 , Armistice Day
        m=nov & w=thu & a=4 , Thanksgiving (U.S.)
        e=47 , Mardi Gras
        e=46 , Ash Wednesday
        e=7 , Palm Sunday
        e=0 , Easter Sunday        
        e=0-49 , Pentecost (49 days after easter)

In the U.S., when certain holidays fall on a weekend, federal workers, as well as many
private employees, get a Monday or Friday off. The full list is given at http://www.opm.gov/operating_status_schedules/fedhol/2011.asp.
If you want a reminder of both the holiday and the day you get off from work, here's an example of how you would set that up:

	* jul 4 , Independence Day
	m=jul & c=4 , Independence Day (observed as a federal holiday)

=head1 INTERNATIONALIZATION

B<When> has at least partial support for Czech, Danish, Dutch,
English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, and Ukrainian.
If B<When> has not been translated into your language,
or has only been partially translated, the text that hasn't been translated 
will be displayed in English.
B<When> should automatically detect what language you use (via your $LANG
environment variable), and if B<When> has been translated into that language,
that's what you'll get -- B<When>'s output will be in your language, and
B<When> will also expect you to use that language in your calendar file
for the names of the months and the days of the week.

Your calendar file must be in UTF-8 (or ASCII, which is a subset of UTF-8).
If your calendar file is in some other encoding, such as ISO-8859, B<When>
will typically be able to detect that, and will refuse to read it.
Command-line options can also contain UTF-8.

Some terminal emulators
(aterm, ...) display accented characters as garbage,
but others (mlterm, xterm...) can display them correctly.
B<When> checks the $TERM environment variable, and if it equals
"mlterm" or "xterm", then accented characters will be displayed. Otherwise,
they are filtered out of the output.
You can override this by putting a line like

        filter_accents_on_output = 0

or

        filter_accents_on_output = 1

in your ~/.when/preferences file. I'd be interested in hearing from
any users who can suggest a better mechanism for this than attempting to
interpret the $TERM variable.

On input, accents are allowed, but not required, e.g., in a French-language
input file, the date 2005 Fev 17 could be given with an accented e or an
unaccented one, and either will work. If an input month or day of the week does
not match any of the ones for your language, then B<When> will try
to interpret it as English instead.

You can put a line like

        language = fr

in your preferences file to set your language, or supply the --language
option on the command line, but that's not necessary if your $LANG
environment variable is set correctly.

=head1 FORMAT OF THE PREFERENCES FILE

Each line consists of something like this:

        variable = value

Whitespace is ignored everywhere except inside the value. Variable names
are case-insensitive. Blank lines are ignored.

=head1 MORE EXAMPLES

A useful command to have your shell execute when you log in is this:

        when --past=0 --future=1

To print out a calendar for a full year to come:

        when --past=0 --future=365 c

=head1 POPPING UP YOUR CALENDAR WHEN YOU LOG IN

Your calendar doesn't do you any good if you forget to look at it
every day. An easy way to make it pop up when you log in is to
make your .xsession or .xinitrc file look like this:

        /usr/bin/when --past=0 --future=1 &>~/when.today
        emacs -geometry 70x25 -bg bisque ~/when.today &
        startkde

The .xsession file is used if you have a graphical login manager
set up on your machine, the .xinitrc if you don't. In this example,
the first line outputs your calendar to a file. The complete path
to the B<When> program is given, because your shell's path variable
will not yet be properly initialized when this runs. The second
line pops up a GUI emacs window, which is distinctively colored so
that it will catch your eye. The last line starts your window
manager, KDE in this example. Whatever window manager you use,
just make sure to retain the preexisting line in the file that starts
it, and make sure that that line is the very last one in the file.

=head1 SORTING BY TIME OF DAY

If you want the various items that lie on a single day to be printed out in
a certain order, the simplest way to do it is to put them in that order in the
input file. That method won't work, however, when some of the items lie on dates
that are determined by expressions rather than given explicitly. The most common
reason for wanting to do this kind of thing is that you have things you need to do
at certain times during the day, and you want them sorted out by time. In this situation,
you can give a time at the beginning of the item's text, and B<When> will recognize that
and sort the items by time. Times can be in h:mm or hh:mm format. If --ampm is set,
then an optional
suffix a or p can be used for AM or PM, e.g., 9:30a for 9:30 AM. If you use AM/PM
time, then you can also, e.g., set --auto_pm=9 so that hours less than 9 are automatically
assumed to be PM. Here is an example:

        2010 apr 25 , 7:00 dinner at the anarcho-syndicalist commune
        w=sun , 10:00 church

April 25, 2010 is a Sunday, so on that date both of these items will be displayed.
If --auto_pm is set to 8 or higher, then the 7:00 will automatically be interpreted
as 7:00 PM, and the dinner date will be displayed below the morning church ceremony.

=head1 FANCY TESTS

In addition to w, discussed above, there are a bunch of other variables
you can test:

	w  -  day of the week
	m  -  month
	d  -  day of the month
	y  -  year
	j  -  modified Julian day number
	a  -  1 for the first 7 days of the month, 2 for the next 7, etc.
	b  -  1 for the last 7 days of the month, 2 for the previous 7, etc.
	c  -  on Monday or Friday, equals the day of the month of the nearest weekend day; otherwise -1
	e  -  days until this year's (Western) Easter
	z  -  day of the year (1 on New Year's day)

You can specify months either as numbers, m=2, or as names in your language, m=feb.
You can also use the logical operators & (and) and | (or). The following 
example reminds you to pay your employees on the first and fifteenth
day of every month:

        d=1 | d=15 , Pay employees.

This example reminds you to rehearse with your band on the last Saturday
of every month:

        w=sat & b=1 , Rehearse with band.

The following two lines

        * dec 25 , Christmas
        m=dec & d=25 , Christmas

both do exactly the same thing, but the first version is easier to
understand and makes the program run faster. (When you do a test, B<When>
has to run through every day in the range of dates you asked for,
and evaluate the test for each of those days. On my machine, if I
print out a calendar for a whole year, using a file with 10 simple
tests in it, it takes a few seconds.)
Parentheses can be used, too.

Depending on your nationality and religion, you probably have a bunch
of holidays that don't lie on fixed dates. In Christianity, many of
these (the "movable feasts") are calculated relative to Easter Sunday,
which is why the e variable is useful.

There is a not operator, !:

        w=fri & !(m=dec & d=25) , poker game

There is a modulo operator, %, and a subtraction operator, -. 
Using these, along with the j variable, it is just barely possible
for B<When>'s little parser to perform the following feat:

        !(j%14-1) , do something every other Wednesday

The logic behind this silly little piece of wizardry goes like this.
First, we determine, using the command `when j --now="2005 jan 26"',
that the first Wednesday on which we want to
do this has a Julian day that equals 1, modulo 14. Then we write this
expression so that if it's a Wednesday whose Julian day equals 1,
modulo 14, the quantity in parentheses will be zero, and taking its logical
negation will yield a true value.

The operators' associativity and order of priority (from highest to lowest) is
like this:

	left	%
	left	-
	left	< > <= >=
	left	= !=
	right	!
        left	&
	left	|


=head1 INCLUDING FILES

If your calendar file gets too large, you may prefer to split it up into
smaller chunks -- perhaps one for birthdays, one for Tibetan holidays, etc.
An easy way of accomplishing this is to install the program m4,
put the line

	prefilter = m4 -P

in your preferences file,
and then put lines in your calendar file like this:

	m4_include(/home/yourname/.when/birthdays)

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<$LANG> to automatically detect the user's language

B<$TERM> to try to figure out if the terminal emulator can display
accented characters

=head1 FILES

B<$HOME>/.when/calendar - The default location for the
user's calendar (pointed to by the preferences file)

B<$HOME>/.when/preferences - The user's preferences.

=head1 BUGS

The filename of the calendar file cannot have unicode in it.
This is because perl's File::Glob::glob() function does not
support unicode properly. See http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod
and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18436275/should-perls-fileglob-always-be-post-filtered-through-utf8decode .

# the day in May Easter is.
